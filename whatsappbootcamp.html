    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

   <p> 1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</p>
   <p> 175g of tahini</p>
   <p></p> 6 sundried tomatoes
   <p> Half a red pepper</p>
    <p>A pinch of cayenne pepper</p>
    <p>1 clove of garlic</p>
   <p>A dash of olive oil</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

   <p> Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</p>
   <p> Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</p>
   <p> Add all the ingredients into a food processor</p>
   <p> Process all the ingredients into a paste.</p>
    <p>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</p>

   <p> For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese.</p> <h3>Experiment and see what works for you.</h3>

    <h1>Storage</h1>

    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

   <p> Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
